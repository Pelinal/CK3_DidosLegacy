 EVTDESC_carthage_morrocco:0 "You are Gisgo, the ruler of Siga, and you are one of the last preservers of Punic culture. Juba was your father, and his family was forced to flee the Byzantine province of Africa during the chaos of the Muslim conquests.\n\nHe was a brave and highly skilled warrior so he decided to carve out a new land for our people, in Siga, so that we might survive. I shall honour his determination and patriotism - and retake our great city!"
