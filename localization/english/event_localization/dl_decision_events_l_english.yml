 EVTNAME_cflavour_10:0 "The Dabke Ball"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_10:0 "In antiquity, our ancestors - the Phoenicians - practiced a religious dance form now known as Dabke. Though the specifically Canaanite aspects of the dance have been lost to the past, the Levantine Arabs still practice the dance today.\nPerhaps we should invite some of these dancers and begin to recover the old techniques for future generations?"
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_10:0 "I shall organise a grand ball!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_10:0 "That sounds like a lot of effort..."
 EVTNAME_cflavour_11:0 "The Main Event"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_11:0 "At the behest of yourself, a herald has been sent calling upon any Levantine dancers to appear at your court for selection for your grand ball. Hundreds of applicants have arrived and the competition was whittled down to the best fifteen dancers. Now all that remains is to provide pay for their services on the night."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_11:0 "Don't go spending it all in one place!"
 EVTNAME_cflavour_12:0 "The Nibbles on the side"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_12:0 "No true gathering is complete without food and drink. You are presented with two options: pay for the most lavish wines and line the tables with a wide array of delicacies from across the realm, or buy a few barrels of cider and a few plates of cheap snacks."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_12:0 "Go all out, none shall go hungry or thirsty!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_12:0 "I'm sure people will understand I have a budget to stick to."
 EVTNAME_cflavour_13:0 "Consulting the Cohenim"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_13:0 "The feast and the entertainment is prepared for your grand ball. All that is left is to consult the Cohenim, as the Dabke dance is of religious import to us Canaanites."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_13:0 "We honour Marqod, the god of dance!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_13:0 "Do I really need to consult the Cohenim?..."
 EVTNAME_cflavour_14:0 "To mingle, or not to mingle?"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_14:0 "The night has dawned. You appear at the ballroom to see the guests having taken their seats already and are chatting away to their hearts' content. The dancers began strutting their stuff the second you walked through the main entrance. Now the question is, where to sit?" 
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_14_gregarious:0 "I'll take my place at the head of the centre table!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_14_gregarious:0 "I'll sit on that small table closest to the exit."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_14_shy:0 "I'll gather all my strength and sit at the head of the centre table."
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_14_shy:0 "This seat is closest the exit, with only a few sitting at this table." 
 EVTNAME_cflavour_15:0 "A mysterious hand"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_15:0 "Having finished your large portion of olives, you desire more. On the opposite side of the table sits a fresh, untouched bowl filled to the brim with those tasty morsels. You arise from your seat and head for the nice snack. Out of nowhere, a hand grabs your shoulder and swings you around. It's [new_friend.GetName]. Clearly tipsy, [new_friend.GetSheHe] states, 'You! I know you! You look cool. Here. Take this cider. Drink with me.'"
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_15:0 "Well, um, ok then."
 EVTNAME_cflavour_16:0 "The assailant"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_16:0 "Happily tucking into a platter of various snacks, you look to the dancers and watch their moves. Footsteps can be heard of various guests wandering about the hall. A pair of footsteps seems to be heading towards you. You turn to face them, only to be greeted by [new_rival.GetName], who promptly smacks you across the face and flees for the exit, shouting 'You'll pay for what you did!'"
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_16:0 "What? What did I do?"
 EVTNAME_cflavour_17:0 "Down in one"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_17:0 "A tankard is being passed around the tables. The person fills the tankard until the hooch spills over the rim, then the other guests shout 'Chug! Chug! Chug!' as the tankard gets poured down the person's neck. The tankard makes its way to you."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_17:0 "Fill me up! I'll show you who's in charge around here!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_17:0 "Here, you do it. I'm done drinking for the night."
 EVTNAME_cflavour_18:0 "A tempting offer"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_18:0 "You are well and truly out of it after eight, nine or however many tankards you drank. You gaze upon a dancer who catches your eye. The dancer seems to be getting closer. They lean forward and give you a quick kiss on the forehead before dancing back to their spot." 
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_18:0 "Ooh, madam, we aren't done yet!"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_18:0 "Pah, just testing to see if they can do away with my jewellery!"
 EVTNAME_cflavour_19:0 "That one person"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_19:0 "You feel exhausted after several hours of wandering around talking to people, all while inebriating yourself. Slumped in your chair, you continue to drink away. [annoying_person.GetName] pulls up in the nearest chair and begins poking you. Poke. Poke. Poke. 'Haha, look at you, you lightweight. I can't handle two tankards, please take me home mom! Waaaah!'"
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_19:0 "Cower with your arms about your head"
 EVTOPTB_cflavour_19:0 "Turn and face, staring directly in [annoying_person.GetHerHis] eyes"
 EVTOPTC_cflavour_19:0 "You asked for it! *Thwack*"
 EVTNAME_cflavour_20:0 "All by myself"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_20:0 "You started the night with a smile on your face. A few guests recognised you and said nice things about how you rule, but seemed to be more polite than actually meaning it. Then they wandered off to talk to other people. You have found yourself on a corner table, with all the other seats vacant and just a tankard of cider to keep you company."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_20:0 "How did it come to this?"
 EVTNAME_cflavour_21:0 "Fin"
 EVTDESC_cflavour_21:0 "The event has run its course. All the guests have filed out of the building and the dancers left after them. You are the last one in the building, inspecting the empty tankards, some of which knocked over and the various puddles of spilled drink and vomit sparsely decorating the floor. It was a good event, but you are glad you are not the one clearing up afterwards."
 EVTOPTA_cflavour_21:0 "Maybe I should do this again sometime."
